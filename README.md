🎓 Student Success Prediction Project
This repository contains the STAT 7020 course project focused on analyzing and predicting student success using a dataset of high school students. The objective is to identify key academic and demographic factors that influence a student's likelihood to apply for graduate school (either inland or abroad) or seek employment.
